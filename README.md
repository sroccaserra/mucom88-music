Learning how to write MML and mucom88 songs.

## Requirements

- Install SDL2 with the development files for your platform
- Clone the [mucom88 repo](mucom88)
- Build the `mucom88` and `miniplay` binaries (I did `cd src; make; make mucom88; make mini`)
- Make the `mucom88` and `miniplay` binaries available in your `$PATH`
